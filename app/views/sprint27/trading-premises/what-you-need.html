            <p>You'll need the following information for each agent:</p>
            <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>your agent's name</li>
                <li>your agent's business structure</li>

            <p>Depending on your agent's circumstances, you may also need:</p>
            <ul class="list list-bullet">

                <li>your agent's company registration number</li>
                <li>your agent's date of birth</li>
