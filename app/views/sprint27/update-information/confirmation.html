                    <ul class="list list-bullet">
                        <li>paid all of your fees so far - you need to pay the current amendment fee</li>
                        <li>not paid any of your previous fees - you need to pay the total from the itemised breakdown</li>
                        <li>paid some of your fees so far, but not all of them - you need to deduct what you&#8217;ve paid from the total of the itemised breakdown and pay what&#8217;s left</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Your application won&#8217;t be reviewed by HM Revenue and Customs until all the fees are paid.</p>
